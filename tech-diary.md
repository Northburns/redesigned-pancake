# Tech diary

Just some quick notes made during dev.

## Files vs classes

Wait, didn't I read in Godot's manual that a `.gd` file is a class? So, maybe refactor the whole "player state / input / s_floor / etc" combo.

## Yield

I have a bad feeling I may have botched the yield thing in `camera_handler.gd`. Oh well, it looks fine. For possible future development, I may have to refactor it hard :smile:
